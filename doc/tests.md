Outline of test cases

- basics - create a repository, add random stuff to it and make sure it can be retrieved

- versions - check that multiple versions can be retrieved, and that config turns it off

- autoindex - check that autoindexing works and that config turns it off

- multiple copy bug - check that it works when more than one path maps to the same hash

- pending v file not found
